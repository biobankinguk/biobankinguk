This repository aims to contain all code pertaining to the **UKCRC Tissue Directory and Co-ordination Centre**; everything that lives under the domain `biobankinguk.org` should be here if it is under source control.

In practice, there is ongoing work to migrate the live Tissue Directory and API codebase here.

This repository will contain a few applications, some shared code, and some other useful bits and pieces for development.

Distinct applications may have their own `README` files for guidance on getting started. There is a guide below.
