# üè• BiobankingUK Tissue Directory

This monorepo contains all the applications and tools for the complete BiobankingUK Tissue Directory stack.

The stack is used to run the **UKCRC Tissue Directory and Co-ordination Centre** Directory and its peripheral services, but is open source and can be used in part or wholly for other instances.

## üìÇ Guide to Repository Structure

The `src/` folder contains roughly project or app categorised folders, which also have Visual Studio Solutions in. Each Solution contains all the relevant projects including dev dependencies, so it's generally a good idea to use the solution of the project or app area you are doing work on.

### Repository structure

- `.github/` - GitHub Actions and Workflows for building and releasing the stack, managing the repo
- `docs/` - Source for the documentation site
- `elastic-search/` - Configuration scripts to setup the required elastic search instance
- `sample-seed-data/` - Sample Reference data for the directory database
- `scripts/` - Various scripts for Directory management
- `sql/` - Various SQL scripts used to add/repair database records
- `src/` - Projects Source Code, detailed below
