# Overview

This documentation is a guide for users of the Directory's Web API.

It contains guidance on authenticating, and using the public facing parts of the API, as well as some details on internally used endpoints.

The primary external use of the API today is for the Bulk Submissions facility.

## OpenAPI (Swagger) Documentation

An OpenAPI reference site is hosted by the API application at its root (`/`).

The Production TDCC API's reference is [here](https://submissions.biobankinguk.org).
