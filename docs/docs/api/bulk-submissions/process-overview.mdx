import TOCInline from "@theme/TOCInline";

Typically, data is submitted to the Directory manually, by Organisation Administrators through forms in the web application.

However for many Organisations, this is an unrealistic expectation,
due to the volume of data and the need to aggregate individual sample records into an anonymised, summarised **Collection**.

The Directory API provides a set of HTTP endpoints and a process for submitting sample records in Bulk,
and the Directory will take care of the aggregation and surfacing of data via Search.

<TOCInline toc={toc} />

## Prerequisites

All Bulk Submission endpoints described here require **Token Authentication**.

This process guide assumes you have a token and will use it to authenticate all requests.

Getting a token in turn requires **Client Credentials** for an **Organisation**.

- Generating Client Credentials is covered in the [Directory Guide](directory/bulk-submissions/api-credentials)
- Authenticating with Basic Auth (for the `/token` endpoint) is described in the [Authentication](../getting-started/authentication) documentation.
- Authenticating with an access token is described in the [Authentication](../getting-started/authentication) documentation.

:::info
Tokens have a short lifetime (e.g. 1 day), but last longer than a single
request, so a client can cache and reuse a token until it expires, and only
then request a new one.
:::

## 1. Submitting data

The first step of the Bulk Submissions process is to submit the data to a staging area.

Submissions are made at the `/submit` endpoint, for a given Organisation Internal Identifier:

|            |                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Method** | `POST`                                  |
| **URL**    | `https://<submissions-api>/submit/{id}` |

| Parameter | Type  | Description     |
| --------- | ----- | --------------- |
| `id`      | route | Organisation ID |

The payload is detailed in the [OpenAPI spec](https://submissions.biobankinguk.org/),
but some less obvious aspects are described here.

It is possible (and sometimes desirable) to make multiple submissions to staging before proceeding with committing the data.

:::tip
A single submission has a record limit of 10,000 operations.
:::

### Operations

Submission payloads can contain multiple **Operations**:

#### Submit

`Submit` will insert or update a record in the staging area.

When the staged data is committed, this record will be included in the live dataset

`Submit` operations will have further requirements of mandatory properties.
Some of these requirements are conditional on other property values.
See below for details depending on the submitted record type.

#### Delete

`Delete` will stage a deletion request for a record

When the staged data is committed, this record will be deleted from the live dataset

`Delete` operations only need to specify the identifying properties of the record.
These are properties marked as **required** in the OpenAPI model.

### Submission Record Types

There are three record types that can be contained in a Submission:
**Samples**, **Diagnoses** and **Treatments**.

While the API will accept and correctly store diagnoses and treatments,
they are of no use at this time as the Directory only deals with samples.

### Sample records

Submitting Sample Records requires a number of additional mandatory properties,
including some which are conditionally required based on other property values.

:::tip Lookup valid values
The valid values differ in different Directory instances, based on configuration,
but are accessible from public API endpoints on the Directory **website** app (**not** the API app).

These endpoints are in the form

```
https://<directory-website>/api/<propertyname>
```

(unless the notes below indicate a different data type than the matching property name.)

<details>
  <summary>PreservationType Example</summary>
  <div>

You can see valid values for `PreservationType` and which `StorageTemperature` requires them
by making the following request:

|            |                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method** | `GET`                                              |
| **URL**    | `https://<directory-website>/api/PreservationType` |

and in the response payload, you can see that the `StorageTemperature` `RT` requires a valid `PreservationType`
of either `Paraffin`, `Resin (EM)` or `Resin (LM)`.

<details>
    <summary>Sample Response payload</summary>
    <div>

[
  {
    "Id": 4,
    "Value": "N/A",
    "SortOrder": 0,
    "StorageTemperatureId": null,
    "StorageTemperatureName": "",
    "PreservationTypeCount": 0
  },
  {
    "Id": 1,
    "Value": "Paraffin",
    "SortOrder": 1,
    "StorageTemperatureId": 1,

    "PreservationTypeCount": 0
  },
  {
    "Id": 2,
    "Value": "Resin (EM)",
    "SortOrder": 2,
    "StorageTemperatureId": 1,
    "StorageTemperatureName": "RT",
    "PreservationTypeCount": 0
  },
  {
    "Id": 3,
    "Value": "Resin (LM)",
    "SortOrder": 3,
    "StorageTemperatureId": 1,
    "StorageTemperatureName": "RT",
    "PreservationTypeCount": 0
  }
]
```

The Open API spec is poor at expressing these conditional relationships,
so we cover that information here:

| Property              | Mandatory status                                            | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## 2. Checking Submission Status

When a `POST` request is made to the `/submit` endpoint,
if it passes the initial validation a `Submission ID` will be returned.

This ID value can be used to query the status of the submission,
anywhere `submissionId` is required.

There are a number of `/status` endpoints detailed in the [OpenAPI spec](https://submissions.biobankinguk.org/)

The status endpoints are primarily provided for two reasons:

- Determining errors with the submitted data
- Determining when the submissions has completed processing.

:::caution
Currently the `recordsProcessed` field in the Status Summary does not function as expected.

It is either `0` (while processing is in progress), or equal to `totalRecords`, once processing is complete.
:::

It is possible to have multiple submissions in progress at a time,
but in order to proceed with committing or rejecting the staged operations
all submissions must have finished processing. The status endpoints allow visibility of this.

Often, the decision of whether to commit or reject is based on the errors identified during processing.
Again, this information is discoverable by the status endpoints to provide feedback and inform that decision.

## 3. Completing Staged Submissions

Once all currently open Submissions have finished processing, there are several choices available:

1. Make more submissions, to stage more data
2. Commit the currently staged data to the live dataset
3. Reject the currently staged data

Making more submissions is as simple as returning to Step 1 above.

:::tip
Committing can only be proceed if there are no currently processing Submissions.
:::

### Commit staged data

If the results of the Submissions processing are acceptable,
the `/commit` endpoint can be used to take **all** currently staged data
(from all Submissions since the last commit or reject) and update the live system with it.

All staged operations (`Submit` and `Delete`) will be applied
to the current live dataset for the organisation in question.

:::tip
If multiple operations (`Submit` and/or `Delete`) have been submitted for the same record identifiers,
the most recent submission will take precedence
:::

#### Update mode

A **Commit** can be performed in **Update** mode, whereby records in the live dataset are left alone
unless they are have a matching (by identifying fields) staged **Operation**.

Essentially this mode **updates** the live dataset for the Organisation
as per the changes described by the staged **Operations**.

|            |                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method** | `POST`                                              |
| **URL**    | `https://<submissions-api>/{id}/commit?type=update` |

| Parameter | Type  | Description           |
| --------- | ----- | --------------------- |
| `id`      | route | Organisation ID       |
| `type`    | query | `replace` or `update` |

No request body is required; the request is a `POST` because it has side effects.

#### Replace mode

A **Commit** can be performed in **Replace** mode, whereby records in the live dataset are deleted
unless they are have a matching (by identifying fields) staged **Operation**.

Essentially this mode **replaces** the live dataset for the Organisation
with the dataset described by the staged **Operations**.

|            |                                                      |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Method** | `POST`                                               |
| **URL**    | `https://<submissions-api>/{id}/commit?type=replace` |

| Parameter | Type  | Description           |
| --------- | ----- | --------------------- |
| `id`      | route | Organisation ID       |
| `type`    | query | `replace` or `update` |

No request body is required; the request is a `POST` because it has side effects.

### Reject staged data

If the results of the Submissions processing are **not** acceptable,
the `/reject` endpoint can be used to delete **all** currently staged operations
(from all Submissions since the last commit or reject) allowing for staging to start over.

All staged operations (`Submit` and `Delete`) will be discarded.

|            |                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Method** | `POST`                                  |
| **URL**    | `https://<submissions-api>/{id}/reject` |

| Parameter | Type  | Description     |
| --------- | ----- | --------------- |
| `id`      | route | Organisation ID |

No request body is required; the request is a `POST` because it has side effects.
