# Overview

This documentation is a guide for users of the Directory and its peripheral functionality.

Some Directory installations may not have all functionality enabled, and the documentation will try to make it clear what is and isn't Core functionality.

For now, this documentation focuses largely on the use of the optional Bulk Submissions functionality, but should over time grow into a more thorough and broad guide.
