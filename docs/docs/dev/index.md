# Overview

This documentation is a guide for developers working on the Directory software stack, whether in the primary repository or a fork.

It contains guidance on setting up a local development environment, and relatively deep technical details of the software implementation.

## Legacy READMEs

Currently it temporarily contains some legacy project readme files, while the repository is refactored and projects are removed.

That readme content can then inform up-to-date usage documentation.
