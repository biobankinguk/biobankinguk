# `api-clients`

## `add`

Add an ApiClient directly to a Biobank. This is the most common action, and essentially joins up most of the other tool and some manual steps into a single command.

### Command

- `api-clients add`

### Options

- `-g` | `--generate` : Generate new ApiClient credentials and output them to the console after adding them to the Database
- `-i` | `--client-id` `<CLIENT-ID>` : The Client Identifier. Required if `--generate` is not specified
- `-s` | `--client-secret` `<CLIENT-SECRET>` : The Client Secret (not hashed). Required if `--generate` is not specified.
- `-n` | `--client-name` `<CLIENT-NAME>` The Client Name. If omitted the Client ID will be used as a name.

### Usage Scenarios

Typically, you probably just want to add a client for a given Biobank, have it auto generate the credentials and then tell you them so you can provide them to the person who needs them:

- `api-clients add --generate <BIOBANKID>`

Or you might already have an ID and Secret, either generated by this tool or from elsewhere:

- `api-clients add --client-id <ID> --client-secret <SECRET> <BIOBANKID>`

Client Secrets should be at least 128 bit strong cryptographically random strings. We store them hashed in the database. (This tool does the hashing, so **you don't need to provide an already hashed secret**).

### Tips

- `biobankId` is `OrganisationId` from the `Organisations` table.
