# Authentication

Most endpoints in the Directory API require authentication.

There are two ways a request can be authenticated, and certain endpoints may require one or other method.

## Basic Authentication (Client Credentials)

Some endpoints accept API credentials directly via HTTP Basic Authentication.

The most important of these is the `/token` endpoint, which can be used to exchange valid credentials for a relatively shortlived access token.

Basic authenticated endpoints behave as follows:

| Scenario                                                   | Response                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic Authorization Header missing, or credentials invalid | HTTP 401 Unauthorized, with a `www-authenticate` header challenge of "Basic" |
| Valid credentials but with inappropriate permissions       | HTTP 403 Forbidden                                                           |
| Valid credentials with appropriate permissions             | Authentication successful                                                    |

### Generating Credentials

API Credentials for a given Organisation can be generated by Organisation Administrators in the Directory frontend, as documented in the [Directory Guide](../../directory-guide/bulk-submissions/api-credentials)

## Token authentication

Most public facing endpoints, such as those comprising the **Bulk Submissions** facility, require an **access token**.

A client can acquire a token by requesting one from the `/token` endpoint.

The `/token` endpoint requires credentials supplied via [HTTP Basic Authentication](#basic-authentication-client-credentials).

Token authenticated endpoints behave as follows:

| Scenario                                              | Response                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bearer Authorization Header missing, or token invalid | HTTP 401 Unauthorized, with a `www-authenticate` header challenge of "Bearer" |
| Valid token but with inappropriate permissions        | HTTP 403 Forbidden                                                            |
| Valid token with appropriate permissions              | Authentication successful                                                     |

### Token Expiry

Access tokens issued by `/token` are reasonably shortlived; expiring 1 day after they are issued.

Clients should expect to receive `HTTP 401 Unauthorised` responses when using an expired token.
In this event, they should proceed the same way as any other occurrence of an `HTTP 401 Unauthorised` response:
seek to acquire a new token from `/token` with their client credentials.
