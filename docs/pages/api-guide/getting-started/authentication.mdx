# Authentication

Most endpoints in the Directory API require authentication.

There are two ways a request can be authenticated, and certain endpoints may require one or other method.

## Basic Authentication (Client Credentials)

Some endpoints accept API credentials directly via HTTP Basic Authentication.

The most important of these is the `/token` endpoint, which can be used to exchange valid credentials for a relatively shortlived access token.

### Generating Credentials

API Credentials for a given Organisation can be generated by Organisation Administrators in the Directory frontend, as documented in the [Directory Guide](../../directory-guide/bulk-submissions/api-credentials)

## Token authentication

## Token Expiry
