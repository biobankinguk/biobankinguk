# The Bulk Submissions Process

Typically, data is submitted to the Directory manually, by Organisation Administrators through forms in the web application.

However for many Organisations, this is an unrealistic expectation,
due to the volume of data and the need to aggregate individual sample records into an anonymised, summarised **Collection**.

The Directory API provides a set of HTTP endpoints and a process for submitting sample records in Bulk,
and the Directory will take care of the aggregation and surfacing of data via Search.
