# API credentials

In order to use the Bulk Submissions service, an Organisation requires credentials for the Directory's API.

These credentials can then be used to access the API directly, or provided to a third party application to handle Bulk Submissions on your behalf.

<SimpleAlert>
  If at any time you forget your credentials, or need to prevent use of the
  current credentials, you can generate new ones which will replace (and
  invalidate) the old ones.
</SimpleAlert>

## Generating the credentials
